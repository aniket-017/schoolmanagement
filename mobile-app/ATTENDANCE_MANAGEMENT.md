Returns classes assigned to the logged-in teacher.

#### 2. Get Class Students
```
GET /api/attendances/class-students/:classId
```
Returns all active students in the specified class.

#### 3. Get Class Attendance by Date
```
GET /api/attendances/class-attendance/:classId/:date
```
Returns existing attendance data for a class on a specific date.

#### 4. Bulk Mark Class Attendance
```
POST /api/attendances/bulk-mark-class
```
Saves attendance data for multiple students at once.

### Frontend Components

#### AttendanceManagement.js
Main screen component with:
- State management for date, class, students, and attendance data
- API integration for all attendance operations
- UI rendering with proper styling and animations
- Error handling and user feedback

#### Key Functions
- `loadTeacherClasses()`: Fetches teacher's assigned classes
- `loadClassStudents()`: Loads students for selected class
- `loadExistingAttendance()`: Loads existing attendance for selected date
- `markAttendance()`: Updates attendance status for a student
- `saveAttendance()`: Saves all attendance data to backend

### Data Flow

1. **Initial Load**: Teacher classes are loaded on component mount
2. **Class Selection**: When class is selected, students are loaded
3. **Date Selection**: When date changes, existing attendance is loaded
4. **Attendance Marking**: Local state is updated with visual feedback
5. **Save Operation**: All marked attendance is sent to backend

## Usage Instructions
