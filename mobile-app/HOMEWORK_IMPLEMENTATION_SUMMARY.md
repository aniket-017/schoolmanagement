# Homework Model Implementation for Mobile App

## Overview
This document summarizes the complete homework management system implemented for the mobile app, following the same structure and functionality as the web application.

## Components Created

### 1. API Service (`mobile-app/services/apiService.js`)
- **Homework APIs**: Complete CRUD operations for homework management
- **Subjects APIs**: Teacher-specific subject endpoints
- **Classes APIs**: Teacher-specific class endpoints

**Homework API Methods:**
- `getAll()` - Fetch all homework with filtering and pagination
- `getById(id)` - Get specific homework by ID
- `create(data)` - Create new homework assignment
- `update(id, data)` - Update existing homework

- Displays homework title, description, subject, class, and due date
- Color-coded status indicators (overdue, due tomorrow, due soon, active)
- Subject-based color coding
- Action buttons for edit and delete operations
- Responsive design with proper spacing and typography

**Status Logic:**
- **Overdue**: Due date has passed
- **Due Tomorrow**: Due within 24 hours
- **Due Soon**: Due within 3 days
- **Active**: Due in more than 3 days

### 3. Homework Modal Component (`mobile-app/components/HomeworkModal.js`)

  - Due today
  - Due tomorrow
  - Due this week

### 5. Homework Detail Modal (`mobile-app/components/HomeworkDetailModal.js`)
**Features:**
- Comprehensive homework information display
- Student progress tracking
- Resource links with clickable URLs
